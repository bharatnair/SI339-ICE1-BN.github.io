			<p> <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em> was a series of graphic novels created by Franco-Belgian cartoonist, Hergé. The series is marked by Hergé's lovely <em>ligne claire</em> art style and it's host of endearing characters and wonderous locations.</p>
			<p>I've adored them ever since my father once showed it to me when I was about six or seven years old. He told me how he, as a child, was so drawn by the adventure, camaraderie, and humor. He loved them, and he simply had to share with his son.</p>
			<p>One day, I hope I may have the pleasure to continue that tradition and share it with my own child.</p>
			<p>A few of my favorite ones are <em>Tintin in The Land of Black Gold</em>, <em>Tintin in Tibet</em>, and <em>Tintin and the Black Island</em></p>
